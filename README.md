# My self presentation app

I believe the best way to self present as a frontend dev is to develop presentation app telling who I am and showing some of my frontend abilities. So here we go! =)

Main feature of this app besides presentation of me is styles built on <b>SASS</b> as style compiler and <b>CSSVaraibles</b> to achieve small, fast and reliable themization without any UI/CSS library

## Stack

- Typescript
- React/Effector
- Sass with CSSVariables
- Webpack
